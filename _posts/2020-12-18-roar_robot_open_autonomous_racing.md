For the final project of EECS 206A at UC Berkeley in Fall 2020, I participated in [Berkeleyâ€™s ROAR competition](https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/research1/roar/) with four other students. In this year, eight teams raced their autonomous AI agents around a track. We [won the Grand Prize in *2020 ROAR S1 series*](https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/inaugural-roar-results-and-expansion/). I led the perception part of this project, designed and implemented the lane detector and the lane following planner, and assisted with obstacle detection. For more information, please check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bcwingnut/ROAR), [slides](/assets/ROAR_Presentation.pdf) and [website](/ROAR).

Here is a video of a full loop with lane following:
