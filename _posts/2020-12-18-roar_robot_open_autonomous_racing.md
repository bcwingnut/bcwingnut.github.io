For the final project of EECS 206A at UC Berkeley in Fall 2020, my project team participated in [Berkeley’s ROAR competition](https://vivecenter.berkeley.edu/research1/roar/), in which teams race 1/10th scale self-driving cars around a track and compete for various prizes. We were fortunate enough to win the Grand Prize in this year’s *2020 ROAR S1 series* and have published [our code](https://github.com/bcwingnut/ROAR) on GitHub.

The website of our final project is [here](https://asdegoyeneche.github.io/ROAR/).
