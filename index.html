    I am a Master's student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
    at UC Berkeley. I am working on Assistive Mouse Capstone Project under 
    <a href="https://barskygroup.wixsite.com/home">Professor Brian A. Barsky</a>.
    
    I am also a full-stack software engineer at <a hraf="https://www.teamingxdesign.com/">
    Teaming by Design Platform</a> led by Professor Sara Beckman. 
    
    Before I started my master's program, I worked as an intern at Microsoft, 
    where I improved the reinforcement learning model of Microsoft Bing. 
    
    I am interested in machine learning, computer vision, self-driving cars,
    and web development.

    I am looking for a full time software engineer or data scientist position 
    starting from May 2021.
