    Hi! ðŸ‘‹ 
    I am a back-end software engineer at Tesla. I received a Master's Degree in 
    Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from UC Berkeley in May 2021.
    
    At UC Berkeley, I worked on the Assistive Mouse Capstone Project under 
    <a href="https://barskygroup.wixsite.com/home">Professor Brian A. Barsky</a>.
    I was also a part-time full-stack software engineer at 
    <a href="https://www.teamingxdesign.com/">Teaming by Design Platform</a> 
    group led by Professor Sara Beckman. 
    
    In my undergraduate years, I worked as an intern at Microsoft, 
    where I improved the reinforcement learning model of Microsoft Bing. 
    
    I am interested in machine learning, computer vision, self-driving cars,
    and web development.
