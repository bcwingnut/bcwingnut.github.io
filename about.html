<p>
Being born into a working-class family in China, I grew up during a time of rapid economic development in my hometown of Nanjing. 
I observed firsthand many of the social inequalities that plague developing countries: the income gap is growing. A deteriorating 
environment accompanies industrialization. Marginalized groups, such as girls in rural areas, still face discrimination in education 
and job markets. I appreciate the potential impact that my work in robotics and data science could have in reducing issues of inequality. 
Furthermore, I believe that the development of information technology can and should improve the overall welfare of human society by 
helping to build more fair systems and eliminate the inequity among different social groups.

Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by robots described in fiction as they can accomplish the difficult or repetitive tasks 
that humans cannot or are unwilling to do. At Northeastern University, I developed a humanoid robot that imitates human movements. 
To further explore my interest, I researched imitation learning and reinforcement learning, both of which are essential 
technologies for robotics control. I believe that using robots and automation may eliminate physical disadvantages among males and 
females, old and young, and abled and disabled. Coming from a relatively conservative society where many people still hold stereotypes 
about some minority groups, I am proud that my research may improve the lives of people born with disadvantages. Another focus of my 
research is on the optimization of social resources. When I studied at UC Berkeley, I voluntarily worked for an extra-curricular project 
on smart cities. I also built a mathematical model of urban planning in a contest, where we considered all the social and environmental 
impacts and made the system work equally well for higher-income and lower-income people.

I do not doubt that computer science will help to build a more diverse community in schools and companies. IT products play an 
important role in my studies, especially in English and computer science. While many Chinese students find it difficult to blend 
into the student communities in the US, I overcame language and cultural barriers by making use of information technology. The online 
courses offered on Coursera helped me acclimate to the education system in the United States, while English-learning mobile applications 
improved my communication abilities. I am concerned that many international students lack the courage to communicate with students from 
other groups and hope to address this phenomenon using computer science. In the summer break before my junior year, I got a software 
engineering internship in a startup company that makes educational applications for English learners. Working with professional educators 
helped me understand the difficulties most students faced. As the newest technologies make the classrooms more customizable and vivid 
by making use of artificial intelligence and machine learning, I believe my research will help other international students overcome 
their difficulties in communication.
